## How to use this app
The current date will appear in the top section of the header.

Enter your important schedule item into the appropriate hour timeblock and hit "save" to save your entry. The entry will stay in place even after you close the browser window!

**What do the colors mean?**
* The grey boxes indicate that the respective hour time blocks are in the past.
* The red box indicates that it is the current timeblock! (i.e. at 2pm the 2pm block will be red).
* The green boxes indicate that the respective hour time blocks are in the future!
